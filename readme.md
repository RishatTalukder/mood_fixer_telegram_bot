`Mood fixer` is a telegram bot that helps you to improve your mood by providing you with a variety of activities Like `Jokes`, `motivational quotes`,`music` and `movies` to watch.

This readme file contains all the information you need to know about the bot and also how to build it yourself.

## Start

To start making the bot you need to have a telegram account. Then search for `@BotFather` in the search bar and click on it. 

> Bot father is the official bot that helps you to create a new bot.

This will take you to the bot father chat. Now follow this steps to create a new bot.

If the name is unique then you will get a message like this.

```

By the way, when you've finished creating your cool bot, ping our Bot Support if you want a better username for it. Just make sure the bot is fully operational before you do this.
